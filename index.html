          In an effort to pioneer a new style of dining for Chattanoogans, the menu we’ve created is elemental at its core, mirroring the way you’d entertain guests in your home. Take the opportunity to try a whole slew of menu items with friends or family. We are pretty good at curating the nearly endless options for dish combinations with menu items that honor simplicity, yet never lack in creativity and flavor. We’re pushing the boundaries, and are so excited to have you in the restaurant.
